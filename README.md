Initially, I created a model using the **GloVe** embeddings which achieved F1 score of **0.74**. This can be found in the *twitter_text_classification_GloVe.ipynb* file. 

I then created a separate model by implementing **BERT**, which achieved F1 score of **0.79**. This can be found in the *twitter_text_classification_BERT.ipynb* file
